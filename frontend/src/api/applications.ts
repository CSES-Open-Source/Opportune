/**
 * 
What is the issue?
A clear description of the task or feature to be implemented by the engineers.

Create a new file applications.ts in frontend/src/api.
Create Application.ts in src/types to store the types related to API calls.
Implement API function calls for Application in the frontend. These functions are the endpoints in the frontend that interact directly with the backend endpoints.
Additional context
Add any other context or screenshots about the enhancement here.

For more information about what to send to the backend in the body, query and param, look at the backend documentation
Feel free to reference the users.ts API functions that I have implemented
Note

The JSON sent by the backend can only contain primitive types like strings, therefore the parser for company can be used to parse the dates for each applicationStatus.
