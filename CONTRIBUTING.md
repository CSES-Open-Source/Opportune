## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

**Note**: You may have to restart terminal after installing each environment.

#### Downloading Git (and Git Bash)

1. Download git and git bash by following [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Set up Git Bash as the shell for running command line prompts (in VSCode or directly openning Git Bash)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git -v
   ```
   This should output something like this:
   ```bash
   git version 2.46.0.windows.1
   ```

#### Downloading Node.JS

1. Download **nvm (Node Version Manager)**. Follow the instructions on in [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) for the details.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   nvm -v
   ```
   This should output the version of nvm you installed.
3. Install **Node.js v18.20.4**:
   ```bash
   nvm install v18.20.4**
   ```
4. Switch to the installed version:
   ```bash
   nvm use v18.20.4**
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   The results should be something like:
   ```bash
   v18.20.4
   10.7.0
   ```

### Setting Up the Local Repository

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the origin repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/Opportune.git
   ```
3. Create a **remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add [your-username] https://github.com/[your-username]/Opportune.git
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   The output should be something like the following:
   ```bash
   [your-username]    https://github.com/[your-username]/Opportune.git (fetch)
   [your-username]    https://github.com/[your-username]/Opportune.git (push)
   origin  https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/Opportune.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/CSES-Open-Source/Opportune.git (push)
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

1. Open an instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Open another instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
4. Install backend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Setting Up the Local Development Database

#### MongoDB

1. Go to [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new account (or login to an existing account if you already have one).
2. **Create a new project** and name it Opportune (or anything you like).
3. **Create a new cluster** in this project by selecting M0 as the plan and deselect **Automate security setup** and **Preload sample datase**. Feel free to choose and name for the cluster and select any location that is closest to you.
4. Go to **Database Access** (under security in the side bar) and create a new user for yourself. Make sure to select **Atlas Admin** as your role.
5. Go to **Network Access** (under security again) and add a new IP address. Click on **Allow access from anywhere**.
6. Go back to **Database** and click **connect** for the cluster you created. Then select **Drivers** and set the drivers to **Node.js**. Copy the link provided below.
7. Create a new file in the local repo under the `backend` folder called `.env` and add the following to the file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=[link-copied-from-mongodb]
   PORT=3500
   FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Make sure to fill in the `<db_password>` field with the password of your account.

#### AWS S3

1. go to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create a new account (or login to an existing account if you already have one).
2. Search for S3 in the search bar and **create a new bucket**.
3. Then search for IAM in the search bar and create a new user (feel free to name it anything you like), make sure to give the user the **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy. This allows the users to have access to your S3 bucket.
4. For the user created, **add a new access key**. Make sure to keep this page open so that we can copy the Access Key.
5. Then go to the `.env` file under the `backend` folder again and add the following to the file:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[access-key-id]
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secret-access-key]
   AWS_REGION=[region-of-bucket]
   ```
   Make sure to copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secrete Access Key** from the page in step 4 and fill in the region if your bucket.

#### Firebase

1. Go to [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/) in click on **Go to console** on the top right of the page.
2. Click **Create a project** and create a project, feel free to name it anything you like (or just Opportune).
3. Go to the **Get started** portion of the page and add a new **web app** to the project.
4. After adding an app to the project, you will see your secrets. Create a new file in the local repo under the `backend` folder called `.env` and add the following to the file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[api-key]
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=[auth-domain]
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=[project-id]
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=[storage-bucket]
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[messaging-sender-id]
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[app-id]
   ```
5. Go back to the firebase console and select **Authentication** on the homepage, click **Set up a new sign in provider** and choose Google as the provider.

### Running the Backend and Frontend

1. Open an instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open another instance of git bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
4. Install backend libraries:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Phew... That was a lot of setting up. But you are good to go now!

### Improving Documentation

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch for the current issue you are working on:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b origin/main [name-of-branch]
   ```
2. Make changes to the branch and **commit changes**. I would recomment using VSCode version control or GitHub Desktop for making commits.
3. Run lint in respective frontend and backend directories:
   ```bash
   npm run lint-check
   ```
   Make sure to fix all lint errors before pushing your code.
4. **Push** the commits to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push [your-username] HEAD
   ```
   `[your-username]` is whatever you chose to set the name of your remote repository as. To check this type:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
5. Go to your forked repository and make a **pull request** to the main branch of the original repository. Make sure to fill in the title and description of the pull request.

## Development Guidlines

### Code Style

Please follow these coding style guidelines:

- We recommend using Prettier to format on save, and then running ESLint before making a pull request.
- Indent with tabs and use a 2-space indentation.
- Use semicolons and the end of each line.
- Write clear, concise comments where necessary.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

### Commit Messages
